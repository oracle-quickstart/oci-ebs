# **Terraform modules for Oracle E-Business Suite on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure**
[![Deploy to Oracle Cloud][magic_button]][magic_ebs_stack]

The Terraform modules for Oracle E-Business Suite allow you to provision infrastructure for Oracle E-Business Suite on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure using OCI Resource Manager and Terraform. Oracle E-Business suite can be deployed on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure in single availability domain or multi availability domain architecture.The modules can be used to create infrastructure for Oracle E-Business Suite in single Availability Domain as well as multiple Availability Domains.

## **How to use this module**

### **Using OCI Resource Manager**
1. Click [![Deploy to Oracle Cloud][magic_button]][magic_ebs_stack]

   If you aren't already signed in, when prompted, enter the tenancy and user credentials.

2. Review and accept the terms and conditions.

3. Select the region where you want to deploy the stack.

4. Follow the on-screen prompts and instructions to create the stack.

5. After creating the stack, click Terraform Actions, and select Plan.

6. Wait for the job to be completed, and review the plan.
   
   To make any changes, return to the Stack Details page, click Edit Stack, and make the required changes. Then, run the Plan action again.

7. If no further changes are necessary, return to the Stack Details page, click Terraform Actions, and select Apply. 

### **Using Terraform CLI**
First off you'll need to do some pre deploy setup.  That's all detailed [here](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-prerequisites).
A terraform version of 0.13.x is required.

1.Clone the repo
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-ebs.git
  $ cd oci-ebs
  ```
2.Update **env-vars** with the required information. The file contains definitions of environment variables for your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy.

3.Rename **terraform.tfvars.template** to **terraform.tfvars**.Update **terraform.tfvars** with the inputs for the architecture that you want to build. A running sample terraform.tfvars file for multiple availability domain architecture is available below. The contents of sample file can be copied to create a running terraform.tfvars input file. Update db_admin_password with actual password in terraform.tfvars file.

4.Initialize Terraform. This will also download the latest terraform oci provider.

  ```
  $ terraform init
  ```
5.Set environment variables by running source **env-vars**.

  ```
  $ source env-vars
  ```

6.Run terraform plan.

  ```
  $ terraform plan
  ```

7.Run terraform apply to create the infrastructure.

  ```
  $ terraform apply
  ```
 
  When you’re prompted to confirm the action, enter **yes**.

  When all components have been created, Terraform displays a completion message. For example: Apply complete! Resources: 47 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.


8.f you want to delete the infrastructure, run:

  ```
  $ terraform destroy
  ```

  When you’re prompted to confirm the action, enter **yes**.

If you want to deploy Oracle E-Business Suite on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure in single availability domain architecture, set AD variable to one of the availability domain i.e. 1, 2 or 3. 

```hcl
AD = ["1"]
```

## **Information about Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources built by Terraform modules for Oracle E-Business Suite**

* The terraform modules creates vcn with regional subnets for each tier. The subnet for bastion host is a public subnet, the subnet for database and application tier is a private subnet. The subnet for load balancer tier is either private or public depending on whether "load_balancer_private" input variable is True or False. When set to True, the subnet for Load balancer is private and when set to False, the subnet for Load balancer is public.

* It is recommended to use shared filesystem for Oracle E-Business Suite multi tier configuration. The Terraform modules create File Storage service filesystem for single as well as multiple availability domain architecture.  For a single availability domain architecture, a single filesystem is created. For multiple availability domain architecture, two such file systems are created, one in each availabilty domain. In addition to shared FSS filesystem, the terraform code also creates a block volume on each application compute node for any non shared application files.

* The shared FSS filesystems can be synchronized by an rsync script in cron. The rsync snchronization script is placed in cron of root user and is commented by default. The script can be enabled to synchornize fileystems after implemenation of Oracle E-Business Suite. 

  ```
  # Credits to lucas.gomes@oracle.com
  # crontab -l
  */30 * * * * /usr/bin/flock -n /var/run/fss-sync-up-file-system.lck rsync -aHAXxv --numeric-ids --delete /u01/install/APPS/ /u01/install/APPSDR/

  # cat /etc/cron.d/fss-sync-up-file-system
  */30 * * * * /usr/bin/flock -n /var/run/fss-sync-up-file-system.lck rsync -aHAXxv --numeric-ids --delete /u01/install/APPS /u01/install/APPSDR
  ```

* The Terraform modules provide option to create private as well as public load balancer using "load_balancer_private" input parameter.  When set to True, a private load balancer is created and when set to False, a public load balancer is created.The backend set of each load balancer has application servers added to it.

* Separate pairs of SSH keys can be used for bastion host and rest of the compute infrastructure resources. It is also possible to use the same key. In that case, same key is required as input to instance and bastion instance variables in env-vars.

  For example,
  ```
  ### Public key used on the instance
  export TF_VAR_ssh_public_key=/home/oracle/tf/<mykey.pub>

  ### Public key used on the bastion instance
  export TF_VAR_bastion_ssh_public_key=/home/oracle/tf/<mykey.pub>
  ```
  For terraform installations on Unix systems, the private half of SSH key pairs should be in OpenSSH format. The instances in private subnet can be reached via SSH on port 22 by allowing agent forwarding in Putty and using Putty authentication tool like Pageant. Note that this does not require copying private SSH key for instances to bastion host.

* The terraform modules ensure that application instances are deployed across different Fault Domains (in round-robin fashion) within an availability domain. Fault Domains protect against unexpected hardware failures and against planned outages due to compute hardware maintenance. For Real application clusters database also, each node of cluster is deployed in a separate Fault domain. 

* The terraform modules expose timezone variable which can be used to set timezone of provisioned compute instances and database systems. 

* The Terraform modules always use latest Oracle Linux image for the chosen operating system for provisioning compute instances. There are chances that minor version of operating system gets upgraded and a new image gets published in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console. In that case, always check the available version of image from oracle Cloud Infrastructure compute console to input this value. For example, if Oracle Linux version is changed from version 7.5 to 7.6, change the value of input variable "linux_os_version" from 7.5 to 7.6.  

* For multi availability domain architecture, the standby database is built using OCI native dataguard association. The standby database is built in second availability configured in input parameter "AD"

* The terraform version has been locked to >=0.12 and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provider version has been locked to 3.93.0 in provider.tf file. To use a version higher than these versions, change the values in the provider.tf file. The terraform modules may require changes for a successful run with a new terraform and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provider version. 


## **Cloud-init template for application servers**

Following is the cloud-init template used to install Oracle E-Business Suite prerequisite RPMs and mount shared file systems on application servers:

```yaml
#cloud-config
timezone: "${timezone}"

packages:
  - rsync
  - nfs-utils
  - ntp
  - oracle-ebs-server-R12-preinstall
  - fss-parallel-tools.x86_64

runcmd:
  - sudo mkdir -p ${src_mount_path}
  - sudo mount ${src_mount_target_private_ip}:${src_export_path} ${src_mount_path}
  - sudo chown oracle:oinstall ${src_mount_path}
  - echo ${src_mount_target_private_ip}:${src_export_path} ${src_mount_path} nfs tcp,vers=3 >> /etc/fstab
  # Run firewall command to enable to open ports
  - firewall-offline-cmd --port=${app_instance_listen_port}:tcp
  - firewall-offline-cmd --port=7001:tcp
  - firewall-offline-cmd --port=7002:tcp
  - firewall-offline-cmd --port=7201:tcp
  - firewall-offline-cmd --port=7202:tcp
  - firewall-offline-cmd --port=7401:tcp
  - firewall-offline-cmd --port=7402:tcp
  - firewall-offline-cmd --port=7601:tcp
  - firewall-offline-cmd --port=7602:tcp
  - /bin/systemctl restart firewalld
```
